# MyNotes

[MyNotes](https://github.com/bayesianruby/MyNotes) is a website that allows you to scan and share notes. 

MyNotes is entirely built in python using the Django framework and the Google Vision API to detect text in images.
This website is dedicated to students in order to share their notes to people from their university. 


## Why MyNotes?

This draft serves as a model of note sharing website for each university. The use of OCR is not necessary and can be easily removed. Mynotes allows the identification of every student at the university with an ID and a password. Each sheet has to be annotated with a Title, a Subject and a Teacher. The student can submit a textual sheet or a PDF. 

Each student has a Menu on the left containing the list of the subjects of his sheets.

This is as follow :
