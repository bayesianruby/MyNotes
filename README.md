# MyNotes

[MyNotes](https://github.com/bayesianruby/MyNotes) is a website that allows you to scan and share notes. 

MyNotes is entirely built in python using the Django framework and the [Google Vision API ](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr)  to detect text in images.
This website is dedicated to students in order to share their notes to people from their university.


## Why MyNotes?

This draft serves as a model of note sharing website for each university. The use of OCR is not necessary and can be easily removed.  Each sheet has to be annotated with a Title, a Subject and a Teacher. The student can submit a textual sheet or a PDF. A search bar is provided to look for the different sheets on a subject in your university.

Each student has a Menu on the left containing the list of the subjects of his sheets.

The menu looks like this :

## Sign Up?
Mynotes allows the identification of every student at the university with an ID and a password.

This identification looks like this :

## Sheets
Each sheet can be written in a editor provided in the website. A button converts the text in a PDF, and saves the sheet. 

The sheet editor looks like this:
