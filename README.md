# MyNotes

[MyNotes](https://github.com/bayesianruby/MyNotes) is a website that allows you to scan and share notes. 

MyNotes is entirely built in python using the Django framework and the Google Vision API to detect text in images.
This website is dedicated to students in order to share their notes to people from their university. 


## Why MyNotes?

This draft is available to serve as a model site of note sharing for each university.
